# MD Analysis
Python script for analyzing MD trajectories.

# About
Thie repository contains various python scripts for analyzing molecular dynamics trajectories in the MDTraj trajectory format.

On the WAG computing cluster, use the following installation of python:
/net/hulk/PMD/Plasmon/brooks/69_python_mdtraj/anaconda2/bin/python

# Contents

Eventually, this will be a standalone module. Currently, this repository contains:

1. msd.py - efficiently compute atomic MSD and diffusion coefficient from a trajectory.
